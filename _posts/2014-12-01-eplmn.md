title: PDP connection retry on ePLMN
category: Notes 
---

This is a minor issue however it has been in a stalemate state after serveral
CT1 sessions. Sometimes it is ridiculously inefficient to reach a common
understanding in 3GPP.<br/>
Here is a little history of the dispute:<br/>
- A CR [C1-123315]() was approved in Rel-11 basically mandating that upon
receiving a cause #50("PDP type IPv4 only allowed") or #51("PDP type IPv6 only
allowed"), the UE should select a PLMN that's not in the EPLMN list to retry
connection.
- In CT#64, HTC and other companies brought up another CR [CP-140312]() trying to reverse the
previous CR, based on the understanding that equivalent PLMN doesn't mean
equivalent services.

TeleSonia is strongly against HTC on this issue. The justifications they gave
for not changing the existing behavior are:
- there are operators that have licenses on multiple networks in different
countries or on different RAT, and each network has its own PLMN ID. They would
normally be labled as EPLMNs and provide the same servies. 
- in RAN sharing scenarios, GERAN may not be able to broadcast multiple PLMN IDs
but has to use a common ID and this common PLMN will be labeled as EPLMN to the
sharing operator's own networks.
In these examples for which real deployment could be found, HTC's CR may cause
the UE to repeatedly select a PLMN that has the same service capability and got
rejected again and again.<br/>
