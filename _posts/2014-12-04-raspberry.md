title: Raspberry arrived!
category: Blogs

Ordered one a few weeks back but it stopped booting after a few days. Probably the SD card slot
was damaged somehow. I returned it and ordered a new one and I'm just glad it
arrives today and gives me something to do during the weekend. <br/>
I plan to turn it into a XBMC TV-box and hopefully get more cartoon resources
than what we have on Netflix now. There are a lot of nice tutorials online so it
should not be a difficult task.
