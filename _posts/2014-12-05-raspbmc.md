Got a 16G SD card from a phone booth and this time everything went smoothly and
finally got my raspbmc running. It took some time to find good respositories
especially for Chinese TVs. [This
repo](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=188490) is pretty cool but some
channels like Cartoon Network is only available in USA.<br/>
The Chinese repo I'm using now is
[xbmc-addons-chinese-1.2.0](https://github.com/taxigps/xbmc-addons-chinese)<br/>
Need to keep looking for French cartoons.
