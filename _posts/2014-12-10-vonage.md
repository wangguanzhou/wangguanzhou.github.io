VG announced a new $100m share buy-back plan, together with this good news it
also announced the write-off of the Brazil residential business. Last night
after seeing the news I was hoping this new buy-back plan would give a pump of
the PPS today but obviously I was wrong again. Any good news is ignored by the
market for this pathetic company.
